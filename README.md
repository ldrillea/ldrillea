<h2>From Oakland and Beyond </h2>
<p> Welcome to the Land's online newspaper. Here's a space where artists, business owners, and intellects can convene peacefully in respect of the work they have published. Each contributing memeber of the culture is celebrated, represented, and rememebered for their effort and presence that has built the door and held it open for future generations. 


<p> This website will visually function as an audio book newspaper, a collection of interviews, profiles, portraiture, and voice over recordings from common folk, celebrities, and scholars. The faces, stories, and voices of the local scene will be documented and posted for for historical purposes. The achievement of generational health and wealth will be televised for stereotypes and wage gaps to be erased. 

<h3> About the Creator: </h3>
<p> Lorenzo Drilleau-Craft, CEO of the brand, dr.craftementary, will complete his sophmore year at UC Irvine drawing a diagram for the service application of his digital product. Double majoring in Film & Media Studies and Literary Journalism, I places images together in a sequence to call attention to political strife and empowerment. I look forward to completing a minor in computer science if possible within my 4-5 year stint at UC Irvine.

<p> Through the production of documentaries, interviews,  photography, short films, and voice over recording, my lens exhibits the  urban art, experience, and poverty. The soon to be copyrighted and trademarked image that I have printed above represents a native's drift of thought during the neglected climate of food deserts, education inequality, and high crime rates. 


<h5> More Ideas for Website: </h5>
<p> Exclusive interviews with painters, rapper, comedians, NBA players, college athetes, clothing designers, youtubers, photographers, filmmakers around the Bay Area. This will be a hub for brand development, literacy, and urban culture.
